# Webot_Follow_Wall

## Description

This project utilizes the Epoch robot and the Webots application to create a simple obstacle avoidance behavior. The robot is equipped with distance sensors that allow it to detect obstacles in its environment and navigate around them autonomously.

## Installation

1. **Install Webots**: Download and install the Webots application from [the official website](https://www.cyberbotics.com/).

2. **Set Up Project Environment**: 
    - Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
    - Open the project in Webots.

## Usage

1. **Run the Simulation**:
    - Launch the Webots application.
    - Open the project in Webots.
    - Run the simulation to see the Epoch robot in action.

2. **Modify Behavior (Optional)**:
    - You can modify the behavior of the robot by editing the `run_robot` function in the `controller.py` file.
    - Adjust parameters such as sensor thresholds or motor speeds to change the robot's behavior.

## Project Structure

- `controller.py`: Python script containing the robot controller code.
- `README.md`: This file, providing information about the project.
- `worlds/`: Directory containing the Webots world files.

## Acknowledgments

- This project is inspired by [Webots](https://www.cyberbotics.com/) and the Epoch robot.
